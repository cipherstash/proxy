certificate_path = "./server.crt"

# Path to the Private Key file.
# Env: CS_TLS__PRIVATE_KEY_PATH

[auth]
# CipherStash Workspace CRN
# Env: CS_WORKSPACE_CRN
workspace_crn = "cipherstash-workspace-crn"

# CipherStash Client Access Key
# Env: CS_CLIENT_ACCESS_KEY
client_access_key = "cipherstash-client-access-key"

[encrypt]

# Env: CS_LOG__FORMAT
format = "pretty"

# Log format
# Optional
# Valid values: `stdout | stderr`
# Default: `info`
# Env: CS_LOG__OUTPUT
output = "stdout"

# Enable ansi (colored) output
# Optional
# Default: `true` if Proxy detects during startup that a terminal is attached, otherwise `false`
# Env: CS_LOG__ANSI_ENABLED

```

### Recommended settings for development

The default configuration settings are biased toward running in production environments.
Although Proxy attempts to detect the environment and set a sensible default for logging, your mileage may vary.

To turn on human-friendly logging:

```bash
CS_LOG__FORMAT="pretty"
CS_LOG__ANSI_ENABLED="true"
```

If you are frequently changing the database schema or making updates to the column encryption configuration, it can be useful to reload the config and schema more frequently:

```bash
CS_DATABASE__CONFIG_RELOAD_INTERVAL="10"
CS_DATABASE__SCHEMA_RELOAD_INTERVAL="10"
```

### Docker-specific configuration

As a convenience for local development, if you use [Proxy's Docker container](../proxy.Dockerfile) with its default entrypoint and the below environment variables set, the EQL SQL will be applied to the database, and an example schema (for example, with the `users` table, from the [README Getting Started example](../README.md#getting-started)) will be loaded. These are turned on by default in the [development `docker-compose.yml`](../docker-compose.yml):

(It is not recommended to use either of these in production.)

```bash
CS_DATABASE__INSTALL_EQL="true"
CS_DATABASE__INSTALL_EXAMPLE_SCHEMA="true"
```

As a convenience for production deployments, with the below environment variable set, the Proxy container will add the AWS RDS global certificate bundle to the operating system's set of trusted certificates. This is recommended when running Proxy on AWS.

```bash
CS_DATABASE__INSTALL_AWS_RDS_CERT_BUNDLE="true"
```

## Multitenant

CipherStash Proxy supports multitenant applications by allowing clients to switch between different keysets at runtime. This enables a single Proxy instance to handle encrypted data for multiple tenants, with each tenant's data protected by separate encryption keys.

### Keyset Commands

#### SET CIPHERSTASH.KEYSET_ID

Sets the active keyset for the current connection using a keyset UUID.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SET CIPHERSTASH.KEYSET_ID = '<keyset-uuid>';
```

**Parameters:**
- `keyset-uuid`: The UUID of the keyset to activate for this connection

**Example:**
```sql
SET CIPHERSTASH.KEYSET_ID = '2cace9db-3a2a-4b46-a184-ba412b3e0730';
```

#### SET CIPHERSTASH.KEYSET_NAME

Sets the active keyset for the current connection using a keyset name.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SET CIPHERSTASH.KEYSET_NAME = '<keyset-name>';
```

**Parameters:**
- `keyset-name`: The name of the keyset to activate for this connection

**Example:**
```sql
SET CIPHERSTASH.KEYSET_NAME = 'tenant-1';
```

### Usage Notes

- These commands must be executed before performing any encrypted operations
- The keyset remains active for the duration of the connection
- If a default keyset is configured in the Proxy, these commands cannot be used and will return an error
- Each tenant should use a separate database connection with their own keyset
- Keyset switching is connection-scoped and does not affect other connections



## Disabling encrypted mapping
Transforming SQL statements is core to how CipherStash Proxy works.
Internally, Proxy takes the plaintext SQL statements issued by your application, and transforms them into statements on [EQL](https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language/) columns.
Proxy does this through an internal process called _encrypted mapping_, or just _mapping_ for short.

In some circumstances it may be necessary to disable encrypted mapping for one or more SQL statements.

For example, you are doing a data transformation with complex logic, and you are doing the transformation directly in the database with `plpgsql`.

A `SET` command can be used to change the `CIPHERSTASH.UNSAFE_DISABLE_MAPPING` configuration parameter.

The parameter is always scoped to the connection `SESSION` - mapping is only ever disabled for the client connection the `SET` command was issued on.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Extra care is required when using `CIPHERSTASH.UNSAFE_DISABLE_MAPPING`.
>
> **If mapping is disabled, sensitive data may not be encrypted and may appear in logs.**

CipherStash Proxy and EQL do provide some protection against writing plaintext into and reading plaintext from encrypted columns.

Always use `eql_v2.add_encrypted_constraint(table, column)` when defining encrypted columns to ensure plaintext data cannot be written.

Unmapped `SELECT` statements should always return the encrypted payload.
If the constraint has been applied, unmapped `INSERT`/`UPDATE` statements should return a PostgreSQL type error.


### Disable mapping
```
SET CIPHERSTASH.UNSAFE_DISABLE_MAPPING = true;
```

### Enable mapping
```
SET CIPHERSTASH.UNSAFE_DISABLE_MAPPING = false;
```

### Note on prepared statements and mapping

CipherStash Proxy only decrypts data of SQL statements that it has explicitly checked and mapped.

If mapping is disabled, any subsequent `PREPARE` will skip the mapping process.

If mapping is re-enabled for the connection, returned data will not be decrypted.

To enable mapping, encryption, and decryption of prepared statements, either:

- a new connection is required, or
- the client needs to prepare the statement again

This behaviour is expected and a consequence of the PostgreSQL protocol.

To prepare a statement, the client sends the SQL in a `parse` message.
Once a statement has been prepared, the client skips the `parse` step, and does not send the SQL again, referring to the statement by a specified name.
If mapping is disabled, Proxy will not map the statement on `parse`, and data returned from subsequent executions will never be decrypted.
If mapping is enabled on the connection, when the client executes the statement it will reference it by name, skipping the `parse` step.
As the statement was not mapped in the `parse` because mapping was disabled at that point, the returned data will not be decrypted


## Prometheus metrics

To enable a Prometheus exporter on the default port (`9930`) use either:

```toml
[prometheus]
enabled = "true"
```

```env
CS_PROMETHEUS__ENABLED = "true"
```

When enabled, metrics can be accessed via `http://localhost:9930/metrics`.
If the proxy is running on a host other than localhost, access on that host.
