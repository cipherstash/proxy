# Developing CipherStash Proxy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before you quickstart** you need to have this software installed:
>  - [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) — see the [installing mise](#installing-mise) instructions
>  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) — see Docker's [documentation for installing](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) and ensure that your Docker daemon is running. On *macOS* and *Linux* you can do this by running Docker Desktop.  See: [Docker Desktop docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/get-docker-desktop/). If you have installed Docker without Docker Desktop then you will need to launch `dockerd` manually.

Local development quickstart:

```shell
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/cipherstash/proxy
cd proxy

# Double check you have all the development dependencies
sh preflight.sh

# Install dependencies
mise trust --yes
mise trust --yes tests
mise install

# Start all postgres instances
mise run postgres:up --extra-args "--detach --wait"

# Install latest eql into database
mise run postgres:setup

# If this is your first time using CipherStash:
#  - install stash CLI
#  - `stash signup`

# If you have used CipherStash before:
#  - `stash login`

# Create minimal mise.local.toml
# CS_WORKSPACE_ID
# CS_CLIENT_ACCESS_KEY
# CS_DEFAULT_KEYSET_ID
# CS_CLIENT_KEY
# CS_CLIENT_ID

# Get the workspace ID
stash workspaces
# add to CS_WORKSPACE_ID

# Create an access key
stash access-keys create proxy
# add to CS_CLIENT_ACCESS_KEY

# Create a dataset
stash datasets create proxy
# add to CS_DEFAULT_KEYSET_ID

# Create a client
stash clients create --keyset-id $DEFAULT_KEYSET_ID proxy
# add to CS_CLIENT_ID
# add to CS_CLIENT_KEY

# Build and run Proxy
mise run proxy
# exit by hitting ctrl + c

# Run tests
mise run test
```

### How this project is organised

Development is managed through [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), both locally and [in CI](https://github.com/cipherstash/proxy/actions).

mise has tasks for:

- Starting and stopping PostgreSQL containers (`postgres:up`, `postgres:down`)
- Starting and stopping Proxy as a process or container (`proxy`, `proxy:up`, `proxy:down`)
- Running hygiene tests (`test:check`, `test:clippy`, `test:format`)
- Running unit tests (`test:unit`)
- Running integration tests (`test:integration`, `test:integration:*`)
- Building binaries (`build:binary`) and Docker images (`build:docker`)
- Publishing release artifacts (`release`)

### Installing mise

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must complete this step to set up a local development environment.

Local development is managed through [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/).

To install mise:

- If you're on macOS, run `brew install mise`
- If you're on another platform, check out the mise [installation methods documentation](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html#installation-methods)

Then add mise to your shell:

```
# If you're running Bash
echo 'eval "$(mise activate bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc

# If you're running Zsh
echo 'eval "$(mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

We use [`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) for faster installation of tools installed via `mise` and Cargo.
We install `cargo-binstall` via `mise` when installing development and testing dependencies.

> [!TIP]
> We provide abbreviations for most of the commands that follow.
> For example, `mise run postgres:setup` can be abbreviated to `mise r s`.
> Run `mise tasks --extended` to see the task shortcuts.

### Rust dependencies

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must complete this step to set up a local development environment.

Install development and testing dependencies (including `cargo-binstall`):

```shell
mise install
```

### PostgreSQL

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must complete this step to set up a local development environment.

We ship containers for running PostgreSQL in different configurations.
The goal is to minimise the amount of configuration you have to do in local dev.

To start all PostgreSQL instances:

```shell
mise run postgres:up
```

Then set up the schema and functions:

```shell
# install latest eql into database
mise run postgres:setup
```

You can start PostgreSQL containers in a couple of different ways:

```
# Start all postgres instance in the foreground
mise run postgres:up
# exit by hitting ctrl + c

# Start postgres instances individually in the foreground
mise run postgres:up postgres
mise run postgres:up postgres-17-tls

# Start a postgres instance in the background
mise run postgres:up postgres --extra-args "--detach --wait"

# Stop and remove all containers, networks, and postgres data
mise run postgres:down
```

Configuration for starting PostgreSQL instances is in `tests/docker-compose.yml`

All the data directories for the Docker container live in `tests/pg/data-*`.
They are ephemeral, and ignored in `.gitignore`.

Sometimes the PostgreSQL instances get into an inconsistent state, and need to be reset.
To wipe all PostgreSQL data directories:

```
mise run postgres:destroy_data
```

### Proxy configuration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must complete this step to set up a local development environment.

There are two ways to configure Proxy:

- Environment variables that Proxy looks up on startup
- TOML file that Proxy reads on startup

To configure Proxy with environment variables:

```
cp mise.local.example.toml mise.local.toml
$EDITOR mise.local.toml
```

Configure `Auth` and `Encrypt`

To configure Proxy with a TOML file:

```
cp cipherstash-proxy-example.toml cipherstash-proxy.toml
$EDITOR cipherstash-proxy.toml
```

Configure `Auth` and `Encrypt`

#### Logging configuration

Logging can be configured by setting environment variables.

There are "levels" and "targets" in Proxy logging configuration.
The levels set the verbosity.

The possible values are:

- `trace`
- `debug`
- `info`
- `warn`
- `error`

A Proxy-wide default level is configured by setting the environment variable `RUST_LOG`.
If this variable is not set, the default value set in the Proxy code will be used.

There are different "log targets" in Proxy.
They correspond to modules or functionalities.
Set log levels for a specific log target to turn on or turn of more verbose logging.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The application code must use the 'target' parameter for the per-target log level to work.
> An example: `debug!(target: AUTHENTICATION, "SASL authentication successful");`

### Running Proxy locally

There are two ways to run Proxy locally:

1. **As a process**, most useful for local development
1. **In a container**, used for integration tests

#### Running Proxy locally as a process

Build and run Proxy as a process on your local machine:

```shell
mise run proxy
# exit by hitting ctrl + c
```

Kill any Proxy processes running in the background:

```shell
mise run proxy:kill
```

#### Running Proxy locally in a container

To run Proxy in a container on your local machine:

```shell
mise run proxy:up
# exit by hitting ctrl + c
```

There are two different Proxy containers you can run:

1. One with TLS (`proxy-tls`)
1. One without TLS (`proxy`)

```shell
# Default `proxy:up` behaviour starts the TLS-less Proxy container
mise run proxy:up

# Explicitly starting the TLS-less Proxy container
mise run proxy:up proxy

# Start the Proxy container with TLS
mise run proxy:up proxy-tls
```

You can pass extra arguments to `proxy:up`, to run the Proxy container in the background:

```shell
mise run proxy:up --extra-args "--detach --wait"
```

Any options you pass via `--extra-args` will be passed to `docker compose up` behind the scenes.

When you have Proxy containers running in the background, you can stop them with this:

```shell
mise run proxy:down
```

Running Proxy in a container cross-compiles a binary for Linux and the current architecture (`amd64`, `arm64`), then copies the binary into the container.
We cross-compile binary outside the container because it's generally faster, due to packages already being cached, and slower network and disk IO in Docker.

### Building

Build a binary and Docker image:

```shell
mise run build
```

You can also do those two steps individually.

Build a standalone releasable binary for Proxy, for the current architecture and operating system:

```shell
mise run build:binary
```

Build a Docker image using the binary produced from running `mise run build:binary`:

```shell
# build an image for the current architecture and operating system
mise run build:docker

# build an image for a specific architecure and operating system
mise run build:docker --platform linux/arm64
```

### Tests

There is a wide range of tests for Proxy:

- Hygiene tests (`test:check`, `test:clippy`, `test:format`)
- Unit tests (`test:unit`)
- Integration tests (`test:integration`, `test:integration:*`)

To run all tests:

```shell
# run the full test suite
mise run test
```

To run hygiene tests:

```shell
# check everything compiles
mise run test:check

# run clippy lints
mise run test:clippy

# check rust is formatted correctly
mise run test:format
```

To run unit tests:

```shell
# run all unit tests
mise run test:unit

# run a single unit test
mise run test:unit test_database_as_url
```

To run integration tests:

```
mise run test:integration
```

#### Integration tests

Integration tests are defined in `tests/tasks/test/`.

Integration tests verify behaviour from a PostgreSQL client (`psql`), to Proxy (running in a container), to a PostgreSQL instance (running in a container).

The integration tests have several runtime dependencies:

- Running PostgreSQL instances (that can be started with `mise run postgres:up`)
- Credentials for CipherStash ZeroKMS (which can be found in the [quickstart](#developing) section)


### Working with Encrypt Query Language (EQL)

The [Encrypt Query Language (EQL)](https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language/) is a set of abstractions for transmitting, storing, and interacting with encrypted data and indexes in PostgreSQL.

EQL is a required dependency and the database setup uses the latest release.

To use a different version of EQL, set the path to the desired EQL release file in the `CS_EQL_PATH` environment variable.



#### Convention: PostgreSQL ports

PostgreSQL port numbers are 4 digits:

- The first two digits denote non-TLS (`55`) or non-TLS (`56`)
- The last two digits denote the version of PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL latest always runs on `5532`.

These are the Postgres instances and ports currently provided:

| Port   | Description                    |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| `5617` | TLS, PostgreSQL version 17     |
| `5532` | non-TLS, Postgres latest       |


#### Convention: PostgreSQL container names

Container names are in the format:

> `postgres-<version>[-tls]`

These are the Postgres instances and names currently provided:

| Name              | Description                    |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| `postgres-17-tls` | TLS, PostgreSQL version 17     |
| `postgres`        | non-TLS, Postgres latest       |


#### Configuration: integration test PostgreSQL and Proxy containers

This project uses `docker compose` to manage containers and networking.

The configuration for those containers is in `tests/docker-compose.yml`.

The integration tests use the `proxy:up` and `proxy:down` commands documented above to run containers in different configurations.

#### Configuration: configuring PostgreSQL containers in integration tests

All containers use the same credentials and database, defined in `tests/pg/common.env`

```
POSTGRES_DB="cipherstash"
POSTGRES_USER="cipherstash"
PGUSER="cipherstash"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="password"
```

PostgreSQL configuration files live at:

- PostgreSQL with TLS: `tests/pg/postgresql-tls.conf`, `tests/pg/pg_hba-tls.conf`
- PostgreSQL without TLS: default configuration shipped with [`postgres` containers](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)

Configuration is quite consistent between versions and we shouldn't need many version-specific configurations.

#### Convention: integration test PostgreSQL containers data directories

The data directories used by the PostgreSQL containers can be found at `tests/pg/data-*`.

These directories contain logs and other useful debugging information.

#### Configuration: integration test environment files

Environment files:

- `tests/mise.toml` - default database credentials used by the `docker-compose` services. Does not include a database port (`CS_DATABASE__PORT`). The port is defined in the named environment files.
- `tests/mise.tcp.toml` - credentials used for non-TLS integration tests.
- `tests/mise.tls.toml` -  credentials used for TLS integration tests. Configures the TLS certificate and private key, and ensures the server requires TLS.

If you ever get confused about where your configuration is coming from, run `mise cfg` to get a list of config files in use.

Certificates are generated by `mkcert`, and live in `tests/tls/`.


## Logging

- Use structured logging
- Use the appropriate targets
- Include the `client_id` where appropriate

Debug logging is very verbose, and targets allow configuration of granular log levels.

A `target` is a string value that is added to the standard tracing macro calls (`debug!, error!, etc`).
Log levels can be configured for each `target` individually.

A number of targets are already defined in `log.rs`.

The targets are aligned with the different components and contexts (`PROTOCOL, AUTHENTICATION, MAPPER, etc`)

There is a general `DEVELOPMENT` target for logs that don't quite fit into a specific category.


### Available targets

```
Target          | ENV
--------------- | -------------------------------------
DEVELOPMENT     | CS_LOG__DEVELOPMENT_LEVEL
AUTHENTICATION  | CS_LOG__AUTHENTICATION_LEVEL
CONTEXT         | CS_LOG__CONTEXT_LEVEL
ENCRYPT         | CS_LOG__ENCRYPT_LEVEL
KEYSET          | CS_LOG__KEYSET_LEVEL
PROTOCOL        | CS_LOG__PROTOCOL_LEVEL
MAPPER          | CS_LOG__MAPPER_LEVEL
SCHEMA          | CS_LOG__SCHEMA_LEVEL
```


### Example

The default log level for the proxy is `info`.

An `env` variable can be used to configure the logging level.

Configure `debug` for the `MAPPER` target:

```shell
CS_LOG__MAPPER_LEVEL = "debug"
```

Log `debug` output for the `MAPPER` target:

```rust
    debug!(
        target: MAPPER,
        client_id = self.context.client_id,
        identifier = ?identifier
    );
```

## Style Guide

### Testing

#### Use `unwrap()` instead of `expect()` unless providing context
When working with `Result` and `Option` in Rust tests, prefer `unwrap()` over `expect()` unless the error message provides meaningful context.
While both are functionally equivalent, `expect()` can introduce unnecessary noise if its message is generic.
If additional context is necessary, use `expect()` with a clear explanation of why the value should be `Ok` or `Some`.

Reference: [Rust documentation on `expect`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.expect)

#### Prefer `assert_eq!` over `assert!` for equality checks
Use `assert_eq!` instead of `assert!` when testing equality in Rust.
While both achieve the same result, `assert_eq!` provides clearer failure messages by displaying the expected and actual values, making debugging easier.



### Errors

- errors are defined in `cipherstash-proxy/src/error.rs`
- not all errors are customer-facing
- for all customer-facing errors ensure there is:
 - a friendly error message
 - an entry in `docs/errors.md`
 - a link in the error message to the appropraite anchor in `docs/errors.md`

#### Keep the errors in one place

Keeping the errors in one place mean that the error structure is
- easier to visualise and understand
- simpler to deduplicate for consistent messaging
- easier to edit messages for consistent tone


#### Align errors to the domain, not the module structure

The error structure attempts to group errors into related problem domains.
eg, the `Protocol` error groups all of the errors originating from interactions with the Postgresql protocol and is used by any module that interacts with the Protocol.
If each module defines errors, it becomes harder to have consistent messaging and more difficult to understand the error flow.


#### Prefer descriptive names and don't use Error

Be kind to your future self and make the error as descriptive as possible

eg `ColumnCouldNotBeEncrypted` over `ColumnError`

Error enum names should contain `Error` but the variants should not.

The enum defines the `Error` for the domain, and the variant describes the error.

eg `ColumnCouldNotBeEncrypted` is a variant of an `EncryptError`.


#### Make errors as friendly as possible, include details and keep a consistent tone

Friendly can be hard when talking about errors, but do your best.


#### Prefer struct definitions

Struct definitions make error message strings slightly clearer.

`UnsupportedParameterType { name: String, oid: u32 }` over `UnsupportedParameterType(String, u32)`

Note: not all errors do this at the moment, and we will change over time.
