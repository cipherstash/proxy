## Disclosure & Response Policy

CipherStash follows a **coordinated responsible disclosure** process:

1. **Submit report** privately via `security@cipherstash.com`.  
2. **Acknowledgement** within 48 hours.  
3. **Assessment** of severity using CVSS and internal risk models.  
4. **Fix development** and patch release in a private branch.  
5. **Coordinated disclosure**, including:
   - New patch release(s)
   - Security advisory on GitHub  
   - Credit to reporter (optional)

We will never take legal action against good-faith security researchers who follow this policy.

## Scope

The following are **in scope**:

- The `cipherstash/proxy` GitHub repository
- All published Docker images published to [Docker Hub under `cipherstash/proxy`](https://hub.docker.com/r/cipherstash/proxy)
- Proxy cryptographic implementations, configuration layers, and CLI tooling
- Key-handling, authenticated encryption behaviour, JSON/JSONB field-level encryption flows
- Documentation or code examples that could lead to insecure usage
- CipherStash’s internal infrastructure  
- CipherStash CTS, ZeroKMS, or other backend products

The following are **out of scope**:

- Example [schema](./docs/sql/schema-example.sql) and [configuration](./cipherstash-proxy-example.toml) (though we are still grateful for any relevant disclosires there)
- Social engineering, physical attacks, or denial-of-service  
- Attacks requiring privileged access to developer machines or CI/CD infrastructure

## Security Guidelines for Contributors

To maintain a strong security posture, contributors MUST:

### ⚙️ Follow cryptographic safety rules
- Do **not** modify cryptographic primitives without prior discussion 
- Avoid introducing new crypto dependencies without prior discussion  
- Never check in test keys, secrets, or example credentials  

### 🛡 Coding & dependency hygiene
- Avoid adding dependencies unless necessary  
- Keep dependencies updated and vetted  
- Use TypeScript for all new code  
- Ensure all code paths that handle keys or encrypted data include type-safe boundaries  

### 🔍 Testing & review
- Submit PRs with tests covering edge cases and misuse-resistant behaviour  
- Flag any changes involving key derivation, key wrapping, AAD, or encryption modes for mandatory security review  
- Do not merge PRs that downgrade security controls or introduce unsafe defaults
